# Using LexFloatClient with Python

## Adding licensing to your app

After you've added a product for your app in the admin portal, you will need to do the following things:

* Note the product id for the product (from the actions menu in the table).
* Download the example project from [Github](https://github.com/cryptlex/lexfloatclient-python/tree/master/examples)

The product id is the identifier of your product that is to be used in the code. The product id of the LexFloatServer and LexFloatClient must match.

### Adding the library to your app

LexFloatClient wrapper for Python can be easily installed through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/cryptlex.lexfloatclient/):

```bash
pip install cryptlex.lexfloatclient
```

LexFloatClient has a dependency on `VS2015` runtime on **Windows**. On the target machines where you will deploy your app, you can install the `VS2015` runtime, if not present, using the link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

### Setting product id

The first LexFloatClient API function you need to use in your code is `SetHostProductId()`. It sets the product id of the product you will be adding licensing to.&#x20;

```python
LexFloatClient.SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID");
```

### Requesting floating license

To receive a floating license, you will use `SetHostUrl()`, `SetFloatingLicenseCallback()` and `RequestFloatingLicense()`LexFloatClient API methods. It sets the LexFloatServer address, the callback for status notifications, contacts the server and receives the floating license.

```python
def main():
    try:
        LexFloatClient.SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID")
        LexFloatClient.SetHostUrl("http://localhost:8090")
        LexFloatClient.SetFloatingLicenseCallback(licence_callback_fn)
        LexFloatClient.RequestFloatingLicense()
        print("Success! License acquired.)
    except LexFloatClientException as exception:
        print('Error code:', exception.code, exception.message)
```

The above code can be executed every time user starts the app or needs a new license.

### Renewing floating license

License lease automatically renews itself in a background thread. When the license is renewed or fails to renew, the callback is invoked (from the background thread).

```python
def licence_callback_fn(status):
    if LexFloatStatusCodes.LF_OK == status:
        print("The license lease has renewed successfully.")
    elif LexFloatStatusCodes.LF_E_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND == status:
        print("The license expired before it could be renewed.")
    elif LexFloatStatusCodes.LF_E_LICENSE_EXPIRED_INET == status:
        print("The license expired due to network connection failure.")
    else:
        print("The license renew failed due to other reason. Error code: ", status)
```

### Dropping floating license

When your user is done using the app, the app should send a request to free the license, thereby making it available to other users. If the app doesn't, the license becomes useless (zombie) until lease time is over.

```python
LexFloatClient.DropFloatingLicense()
print("Success! License dropped.")
```

The above code should be executed every time user closes the app.
