# Using LexFloatClient with Go

## Adding licensing to your app

After you've added a product for your app in the admin portal, you will need to do the following things:

* Note the product id for the product (from the actions menu in the table).
* Download the example project from [Github](https://github.com/cryptlex/lexfloatclient-go/tree/main/examples)

The product id is the identifier of your product that is to be used in the code. The product id of the LexFloatServer and LexFloatClient must match.

### Adding the library to your app

LexFloatClient wrapper for Go can be easily installed using the **go get** command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/cryptlex/lexfloatclient-go
```

**Note:** In case you are using Windows, execute the following command after installation:

```
xcopy %USERPROFILE%\go\src\github.com\cryptlex\lexfloatclient-go\libs\windows_amd64\LexFloatClient.dll
```

This would copy the LexFloatClient.dll to your project directory.

LexFloatClient has a dependency on `VS2015` runtime on **Windows**. On the target machines where you will deploy your app, you can install the `VS2015` runtime, if not present, using the link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

### Setting product id

The first LexFloatClient API function you need to use in your code is `SetHostProductId()`. It sets the product id of the product you will be adding licensing to.&#x20;

```python
lexfloatclient.SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID");
```

### Requesting floating license

To receive a floating license, you will use `SetHostUrl()`, `SetFloatingLicenseCallback()` and `RequestFloatingLicense()`LexFloatClient API methods. It sets the LexFloatServer address, the callback for status notifications, contacts the server and receives the floating license.

```python
func main() {
	var status int
	status = lexfloatclient.SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID")
	if lexfloatclient.LF_OK != status {
		fmt.Println("Error Code:", status)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	status = lexfloatclient.SetHostUrl("http://localhost:8090")
	if lexfloatclient.LF_OK != status {
		fmt.Println("Error Code:", status)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	lexfloatclient.SetFloatingLicenseCallback(licenseCallback)
	status = lexfloatclient.RequestFloatingLicense()
	if lexfloatclient.LF_OK != status {
		fmt.Println("Error Code:", status)
		os.Exit(1)
	}  
	fmt.Println("Success! License acquired.") 
}
```

The above code can be executed every time user starts the app or needs a new license.

### Renewing floating license

License lease automatically renews itself in a background thread. When a license is renewed or fails to renew, the callback is invoked (from the background thread).

```python
func licenseCallback(status int) {
	if status == lexfloatclient.LF_OK {
		fmt.Println("The license lease has renewed successfully.")
	} else if status == lexfloatclient.LF_E_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND {
		fmt.Println("he license expired before it could be renewed.")
	} else if status == lexfloatclient.LF_E_LICENSE_EXPIRED_INET {
		fmt.Println("The license expired due to network connection failure.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("The license renew failed due to other reason. Error code:", status)
	}
}
```

### Dropping floating license

When your user is done using the app, the app should send a request to free the license, thereby making it available to other users. If the app doesn't, the license becomes useless (zombie) until lease time is over.

```python
lexfloatclient.DropFloatingLicense()
fmt.Println("Success! License dropped.")
```

The above code should be executed every time user closes the app.
