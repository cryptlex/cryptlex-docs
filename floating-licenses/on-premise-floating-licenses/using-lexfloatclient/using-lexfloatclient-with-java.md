# Using LexFloatClient with Java

## Adding licensing to your app

After you've added a product for your app in the admin portal, you will need to do the following things:

* Note the product id for the product (from the actions menu in the table).
* Download the example project from [Github](https://github.com/cryptlex/lexfloatclient-java/tree/master/examples)

The product id is the identifier of your product that is to be used in the code. The product id of the LexFloatServer and LexFloatClient must match.

### Adding the library to your app

LexFloatClient wrapper for Java is available on the [central maven repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cryptlex.lexfloatclient/lexfloatclient) and can be easily installed using maven by adding the following dependency in your POM file:

```markup
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.cryptlex.lexfloatclient</groupId>
  <artifactId>lexfloatclient</artifactId>
  <!-- Make sure that you use the latest version -->
  <version>4.5.4</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you can also download the [JAR](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/cryptlex/lexfloatclient/lexfloatclient/) file and add it to your project.

LexFloatClient has a dependency on `VS2015` runtime on **Windows**. On the target machines where you will deploy your app, you can install the `VS2015` runtime, if not present, using the link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

### Setting product id

The first LexFloatClient API function you need to use in your code is `SetHostProductId()`. It sets the product id of the product you will be adding licensing to.&#x20;

```java
LexFloatClient.SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID");
```

### Requesting license lease

To receive a floating license, you will use `SetHostUrl()`, `SetFloatingLicenseCallback()` and `RequestFloatingLicense()`LexFloatClient API methods. It sets the LexFloatServer address, the callback for status notifications, contacts the server and receives the floating license.

```java
try {
    CallbackEventListener eventListener = new CallbackEventListener();
    LexFloatClient.SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID");
    LexFloatClient.SetHostUrl("http://localhost:8090");
    LexFloatClient.AddLicenseCallbackListener(eventListener);

    LexFloatClient.RequestFloatingLicense();
    System.out.println("Success! License acquired.");
} catch (LexFloatClientException ex) {
    System.out.println(ex.getCode() + ": " + ex.getMessage());
} catch (IOException ex) {
    System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
}
```

The above code can be executed every time user starts the app or needs a new license.

### Renewing floating license

License lease automatically renews itself in a background thread. When a license is renewed or it fails to renew, the callback is invoked (from the background thread).

```java
class CallbackEventListener implements LicenseCallbackEvent {
    @Override
    public void LicenseCallback(int status) {
        switch (status) {
        case LexFloatClient.LF_OK:
            System.out.println("The license lease has renewed successfully.");
            break;
        case LexFloatClientException.LF_E_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND:
            System.out.println("The license expired before it could be renewed.");
            break;
        case LexFloatClientException.LF_E_LICENSE_EXPIRED_INET:
            System.out.println("The license expired due to network connection failure.");
            break;
        default:
            System.out.println("The license renew failed due to other reason. Error code: " + Integer.toString(status));
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Dropping floating license

When your user is done using the app, the app should send a request to free the license, thereby making it available to other users. If the app doesn't, the license becomes (zombie) useless until lease time is over.

```java
try {
    LexFloatClient.DropFloatingLicense();
    System.out.println("Success! License dropped successfully.");
} catch (LexFloatClientException ex) {
    System.out.println(ex.getCode() + ": " + ex.getMessage());
}
```

The above code should be executed every time user closes the app.
