# Using LexFloatClient with C, C++ & Objective C

First of all, login to your Cryptlex account and download the LexFloatClient library for Windows, macOS, or Linux:

* [Download LexFloatClient for Windows](https://app.cryptlex.com/developer/sdk-downloads)
* [Download LexFloatClient for macOS](https://app.cryptlex.com/developer/sdk-downloads)
* [Download LexFloatClient for Linux](https://app.cryptlex.com/developer/sdk-downloads)

The above download package contains the library (shared as well as static) which you will be using to add licensing to your app.

## Adding licensing to your app

After you've added a product for your app in the admin portal, you will need to do the following things:

* Note the product id for the product (from the actions menu in the table).
* Download the example project from [Github](https://github.com/cryptlex/lexfloatclient-c).

The product id is the identifier of your product that is to be used in the code. The product id of the LexFloatServer and LexFloatClient must match.

### Adding the library to your app

LexFloatClient example project for C contains the **LexFloatClient.h** header file. In addition to that, it includes the **LexFloatClient.lib** file required in the case of Windows. It contains all the LexFloatClient API functions needed to add licensing to your app.

Depending on the platform you are targeting **(x86 or x64)** you need to link the respective LexFloatClient.dll with your application.

LexFloatClient has a dependency on `VS2015` runtime on **Windows**. On the target machines where you will deploy your app, you can install the `VS2015` runtime, if not present, using the link: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

### Setting product id

The first LexFloatClient API function you need to use in your code is `SetHostProductId()`. It sets the product id of the product you will be adding licensing to.&#x20;

```c
SetHostProductId("PASTE_PRODUCT_ID");
```

### Requesting floating license

To receive a floating license, you will use `SetHostUrl()`, `SetFloatingLicenseCallback()` and `RequestFloatingLicense()`LexFloatClient API methods. It sets the LexFloatServer address, the callback for status notifications, contacts the server and receives the floating license.

```c
int status;
status = SetHostProductId(L"PASTE_PRODUCT_ID");
if(LF_OK != status)
{
	// handle error
}
status = SetHostUrl("http://localhost:8090");
if(LF_OK != status)
{
	// handle error
}
status = SetFloatingLicenseCallback(LicenceRenewCallback);
if(LF_OK != status)
{
	// handle error
}
status = RequestFloatingLicense();
if(LF_OK != status)
{
	// handle error
}
printf("License leased successfully!");
```

The above code can be executed every time user starts the app or needs a new license.

### Renewing floating license

License lease automatically renews itself in a background thread. When a license is renewed or fails to renew, the callback is invoked (from the background thread).

```c
void LF_CC LicenceRenewCallback(uint32_t status)
{
    switch (status)
	{
	case LF_OK:
		printf("The license lease has renewed successfully.\n");
		break;
	case LF_E_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND:
		printf("The license expired before it could be renewed.\n");
		break;
	case LF_E_LICENSE_EXPIRED_INET:
		printf("The license expired due to network connection failure.\n");
		break;
	default:
		printf("The license renew failed due to other reason. Error code: %d\n", status);
		break;
	}
}
```

### Dropping floating license

When your user is done using the app, the app should send a request to free the license, thereby making it available to other users. If the app doesn't, the license becomes useless (zombie) until lease time is over.

```c
int status;
status = DropFloatingLicense();
if(LF_OK != status) 
{
	// handle error
}
else 
{
    printf("Success! License dropped.");
}
```

The above code should be executed every time user closes the app.
