# Overview

This category explains how to use Cryptlex to manage entitlements within your software applications. Cryptlex's feature management tools facilitate the implementation of software flavours, software variants, and paywalls. This is done by the creation of `Product Versions` as an extension to your `Product`.

`Product Versions` consist of a list of `Feature Flags` also commonly known as `Feature Toggles.`
