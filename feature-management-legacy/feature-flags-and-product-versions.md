# Feature Flags and Product Versions

## Feature flags

`Feature Flags`, sometimes also referred to as `Feature Toggles`, are simply true/false values aimed to control parts of your application like a simple switch. Crypltex offers `Feature Flags` with the ability to store data which allows for complex use-cases. Storing data in a Feature Flag is optional. Values stored in feature flags will reflect in your application/service after the license is activated. Any changes in the feature flags will automatically reflect after every server sync.

## Product versions

`Product Versions` are a part of your `Product` and are defined by `Feature Flags`. `Product Versions` need to be linked to `Licenses`. Setting a `Product Version` is optional.
