# Named User Licenses

A named user license is a licensing model in which the software or service is allocated to a specific individual, typically identified by a unique email address.&#x20;

This model necessitates license activation using the designated user's credentials, moving away from the traditional use of license keys.

This model requires linking the user to the license at the time of license creation.

Named user licenses can be either node-locked or floating. Regardless of the type, users must authenticate to access the licenses associated with their account. The typical process involves the following three steps:

## 1- Authenticating the user

User authentication is achieved by calling the `AuthenticateUser(string email, string password)` LexActivator API function.

In scenarios where users have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA), executing the function results in a `LA_E_TWO_FACTOR_AUTHENTICATION_CODE_MISSING` exception. In such instances, it becomes necessary to provide the 2FA code using the `SetTwoFactorAuthenticationCode()` LexActivator API function.

Once the 2FA code has been set, you need to call the `AuthenticateUser()` LexActivator API function again.

## 2- Retrieving the user license

Upon successful user authentication, `GetUserLicenses()` LexActivator API function can be used to retrieve licenses associated with the user. The acquired license key can then be passed to the `SetLicenseKey()` LexActivator API function for further processing. \
\
In scenarios where multiple licenses are linked to a particular user, it is possible to prompt the user's selection of any license for activation purposes.

## 3- Activating the license

Once the license key is obtained, the subsequent activation procedure aligns closely with the guidelines provided in the documentation for each respective [programming language](node-locked-licenses/using-lexactivator/). To activate the license within your application, simply call the `ActivateLicense()` function from the LexActivator API.
