# Terms of Service

By using or accessing the Services, you're agreeing to these Terms,  and our [Data Processing Addendum](https://cryptlex.com/dpa) \(collectively, this “Agreement”\). If you're using the Services for an organization, you're agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and you represent and warrant that you can do so. 

If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing our Services. Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account.You agree to use the Service at your own risk.

## Using our Services

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some content that is not Cryptlex’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

You understand that Cryptlex uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service.

## Your Cryptlex Account

You need a Cryptlex Account in order to use our Services. You may create your own Cryptlex Account, or your Cryptlex Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Cryptlex Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.

You must be above 13 years of age and provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process. Your login may only be used by one person – a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.

To protect your Cryptlex Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Cryptlex Account. Cryptlex cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

## Payment Terms

The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States \(federal or state\) taxes.

For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.

## Your Content in our Services

Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Cryptlex a license to use, store, reproduce, modify such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.

We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and Accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party’s intellectual property or these Terms of Service.

You can find more information about how Cryptlex uses and stores content in the privacy policy. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

## About API in our Services

Customers may access their Cryptlex account data via an API \(Application Program Interface\). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Cryptlex, is bound by the terms of this agreement.

Any abuse or excessively frequent requests to Cryptlex via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Cryptlex, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Cryptlex will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.

Cryptlex reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API \(or any part thereof\) with or without notice.

## Modification in our Services and Pricing

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted.
