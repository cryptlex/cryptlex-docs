# Terms of Service

By using or accessing the Services, you're agreeing to these Terms, and our [Data Processing Addendum](https://docs.cryptlex.com/legal/data-processing-addendum) (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you're using the Services for an organization, you're agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and you represent and warrant that you can do so.&#x20;

If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing our Services. Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.

## Using our Services

You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

Don't use our Services to license or distribute malware or any program or file that is harmful to a computer user.

Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

Our Services display some content that is not Cryptlex’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

You understand that Cryptlex uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service.

## Your Cryptlex Account

You need a Cryptlex Account in order to use our Services. You may create your own Cryptlex Account or your Cryptlex Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a Cryptlex Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.

You must be above 13 years of age and provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process. Your login may only be used by one person – a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.

To protect your Cryptlex Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Cryptlex Account. Cryptlex cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

## Payment Terms

The Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.

For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.

## Your Content in our Services

Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.

When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Cryptlex a license to use, store, reproduce, and modify such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services.

We may, but have no obligation to, remove Content and Accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion are unlawful, offensive, threatening, libellous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise objectionable or violates any party’s intellectual property or these Terms of Service.

You can find more information about how Cryptlex uses and stores content in the privacy policy. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.

## About Software in our Services

Cryptlex gives you a non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Cryptlex as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services as provided by Cryptlex, in the manner permitted by these terms.

You may not copy, modify, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

## About API in our Services

Customers may access their Cryptlex account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including the use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Cryptlex, is bound by the terms of this agreement.

Any abuse or excessively frequent requests to Cryptlex via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Cryptlex, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Cryptlex will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.

Cryptlex reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

## Modification in our Services and Pricing

We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether with or without notice.

Prices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days' notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Cryptlex Site (https://cryptlex.com/pricing) or the Service itself.

Cryptlex shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

## Terminating our Services

You can stop using our Services by cancelling your subscription at any time by visiting the account section of your Cryptlex admin portal, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Cryptlex may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.

If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid-up month or year, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.

Cryptlex, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other Cryptlex service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Cryptlex reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

## Our Warranties and Disclaimers

We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.

OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER CRYPTLEX NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.

SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.

Cryptlex does not warrant that the service will meet your specific requirements, the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable, the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the service will meet your expectations, and any errors in the Service will be corrected.

## Liability for our Services

WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, CRYPTLEX, AND CRYPTLEX’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF CRYPTLEX, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).

IN ALL CASES, CRYPTLEX, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

## Business uses of our Services

If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Cryptlex and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.

We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service. If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

The failure of Cryptlex to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitute the agreement between you and Cryptlex and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Cryptlex (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).
