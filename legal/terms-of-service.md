### 5. Subscription and Payments

Cryptlex offers monthly and annual subscription plans, processed exclusively through our authorized reseller and Merchant of Record (MoR), Paddle. By subscribing, you authorize Paddle to charge your selected payment method in advance on a recurring basis and, where applicable, securely store your payment details for future billing.

You may manage your subscription at any time through the web portal. This includes upgrading or downgrading your plan, which may result in a prorated charge or a credit applied to future billing cycles, depending on the timing and nature of the change. Cancellation of a subscription takes effect immediately, but no refunds will be issued for any unused portion of the billing period.

All subscription fees are non-refundable. This includes partial periods of service, unused time on an active account, or cancellations made before the end of a prepaid term.

Cryptlex may update its pricing from time to time. If changes are made to subscription fees, affected customers will be notified at least three (3) months in advance. Updated pricing will only apply from the start of the next billing cycle following the notice period.

Unless otherwise stated, all fees are exclusive of applicable taxes. Taxes such as VAT, GST, or other indirect taxes may be calculated and collected at checkout by Paddle in accordance with local tax laws.

Failure to pay may result in the temporary suspension of your account. If payment remains overdue for six (6) months, Cryptlex reserves the right to permanently delete your account and cancel your subscription.
