# Features and Entitlement Sets

## Features

Features in Cryptlex represent capabilities or functionalities within your product that can be licensed. If a feature is present in an Entitlement Set or directly assigned to a license, it is considered enabled for that license. Any value associated with a feature (e.g., string, number) is optional and intended for your application logic to interpret.

To create a feature, navigate to `Entitlements → Features` page on the admin portal.

**Note:** A maximum of 200 features can be created per account. If you need a higher limit for your use case, please contact us through [email](mailto:support@cryptlex.com?Subject=More%20Features%20Needed).

## Entitlement Sets

Entitlement Sets are reusable collections of features grouped together to represent a particular package or a product tier (e.g., “Standard”, “Pro”, “Business”, “Enterprise”, etc.). You can create an Entitlement Set that encapsulates a bundle of feature entitlements and apply it to multiple products and licenses. Each feature entitlement within an Entitlement Set can optionally include a value. These values can be interpreted by your application logic to apply constraints or offer conditional access. These Entitlement sets can later be linked with the license.

To create an entitlement set, navigate to `Entitlements → Entitlement Sets` page on the admin portal. You can add many feature entitlements with an entitlement set and set the value for each feature.
