# Reseller Portal

Reseller Admins can log into the reseller portal and delegate the assigned licenses down the line to users or organizations, track activations, and manage customers.

You can find your reseller portal URL on the `Settings -> Customizations` page in the admin portal.
{% endhint %}

## **Reseller Admin:**

Users assigned the "reseller-admin" role have the ability to view and manage all licenses associated with customers under their reseller account. They can also create and manage users and organizations, as well as assign licenses accordingly. This role is designed to enable resellers to effectively oversee licensing and customer access, ensuring seamless management within their reseller account.

### **Offline Activation and Deactivation**

Resellers can assist their customers in performing offline activations and deactivations through the Reseller Portal and their end users can also use the customer portal for offline activations and deactivations. This saves resellers a considerable amount of time on product support.

### **Customer Management**

The Reseller Portal enables resellers to:

* Create, edit, and delete users/organizations.
* Assign and revoke licenses for users/organizations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Resellers cannot create licenses themselves but can assign the licenses to their users and organizations.
{% endhint %}

### **Customizing the Reseller Portal**

You can customize the Reseller Portal experience by:

* Updating the company logo via `Admin Portal -> Settings -> Customizations`.
* Setting up a custom domain for your reseller portal.
