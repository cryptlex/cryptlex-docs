# Customer Portal

Your customers can also log into the customer portal to manage their licenses. They can view their licenses, update their profile etc.

You can find your customer portal URL on the `Settings -> Customizations` page in the admin portal.

## License and User Management&#x20;

Customers have access to a comprehensive overview of their licenses in the customer portal, which includes details like total activations, deactivations, allowed activations and deactivations, validity, status, and more. Depending on a user's role, they'll experience one of two distinct views:

### 1. Organization Admin View:

**Access for:** Users assigned the "organization-admin" role.&#x20;

**Capabilities:** View all licenses associated with the organization. Create and manage users for the organization. Formulate user groups. Link user groups with specific licenses.&#x20;

**Purpose:** This setup ensures organizations can precisely control which members have access to a given license.&#x20;

### 2. User View:

**Access for:** Users with the "user" role.&#x20;

**Capabilities:** View licenses tied directly to the individual user. For users within an organization, view licenses linked to their respective user groups.&#x20;

The design of these views ensures clear and organized license management tailored to each user's specific needs and permissions.

## Offline activation and deactivation

Your customers can also use the customer portal for offline activations and deactivations. This saves you a considerable amount of time on product support.

{% hint style="info" %}
Offline trial activations can't be handled in the customer portal as it requires user authentication. But you can easily host the following website on Github or your own server to automate the offline trial activation process: [https://github.com/cryptlex/offline-trial-activation-form](https://github.com/cryptlex/offline-trial-activation-form)
{% endhint %}

## Downloading releases

Your customers can also download releases of your software app from the customer portal.

## User profile

Your customers can also see and update their profile details like first name, last name, email and password.&#x20;
