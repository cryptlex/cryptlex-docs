# Resellers

The Reseller feature empowers you to invite your sales partners, resellers, distributors, and sales channels to Cryptlex and allows them to effectively sell your software.

* Resellers get a dedicated web portal for managing licenses, users and organizations.
* You can effectively manage and monitor Reseller activity.

## Delegate monetization to Resellers

Start by creating a Reseller and assigning a User to the Reseller with the `reseller-admin` role. A User with the `reseller-admin` role can log in to the **reseller portal** to manage Licenses, Users, and Organizations.

## Managing your Resellers

As an independent software vendor, you can effectively limit Reseller activity using the `Allowed Users` and `Allowed Organizations` properties on the Reseller. Furthermore, you can track Reseller activity using filters and the Audit Logs.
