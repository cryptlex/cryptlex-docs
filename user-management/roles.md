# Roles

Roles help you manage authorization, which enables you to specify the resources that users in your application are allowed to access.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Each account has five reserved roles: **super-admin**, **admin, organization-admin, reseller-admin** and **user**.
{% endhint %}

## Super Admin role

Has full access to all functions of the account. There can be only one super-admin per account. This role is assigned to the user who registers for the Cryptlex account.

## Admin role

Admin role gives your team members complete control of the account except for account deletion, deleting another team member with an admin role and changing roles of team members.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any team member with an **admin** **role** is counted against the admins in your plan.
{% endhint %}

## Custom roles

You can also create custom roles with fine-grained permissions and assign them to your team members.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Any team member with a **custom** **role** is counted against the admins in your plan.
{% endhint %}

## User role

The user role is meant for your customers to whom you want to license your product. This role permits the users to **view** their licenses, activations and releases (if any) for the product for which they have licenses.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any user with a **user** **role** is counted against the users in your plan.
{% endhint %}

## Organization admin role

Customers can either be individual users or entire organizations. For organizations requiring the autonomy to set up user profiles, form user groups, and allocate licenses, assign the 'organization-admin' role. This empowers them to oversee their license distribution and usage internally.

{% hint style="info" %}
Any user with an **organization-admin role** is counted against the users in your plan.
{% endhint %}

## Reseller admin role

The "reseller-admin" role grants users the ability to view and manage all licenses associated with customers under their reseller account. Additionally, they can create and manage users and organizations, as well as assign licenses as needed. This role enables resellers to efficiently manage licensing and customer access within their reseller account.
